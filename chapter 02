Child: I have seen you before. Are you God?
God: Yes, you recognised me correnctly. How have you been recently? I have seen you have not been eating, sleeping well.
You have been thinking a lot about something. You seem lost. What has been wrong with you?
Child: You had said I'll be able to see my friends if I study properly. I have been studying but it is of no use.
It seems I'm too weak. I'll not be able to see them again.
God: You are getting disappointed. Where have you been looking for your friends. Tell me in details.
Child: Everywhere in my home. Everywhere in my books and finally everywhere on my computer.
God: On your computer?
Child: Yes.
God: You looked for them on your books too?
Child: Yes, on each one of my books.
God: Ofcourse, you could not have found them on your home. But you looked for them on your books.
It sounds amusing to me. Why would someone find them on books?
Child: You told me to do so.
God: Did I? I'm starting to doubt myself.
Child: I... I don't remember exactly.
God: Okay leave that. Don't push too hard on your head. Did you try to exchange your books with your friends?
Child: No.
God: And instead you tried to find them on the books you had.
Child: Yes.
God: Now I get it. You are one funny yet amazing kid. I have to go now. Good Bye.
Child: Where?
God: To your friends.
Child: Is it a dream.
God: Yes, it is. Time to go. Take care.
